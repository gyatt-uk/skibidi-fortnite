            Mortdecai (commonly known as Mort) is a main protagonist in All Hail King Julien. He is an incredibly cute
            and somewhat innocent and annoying mouse lemur, although his age is not confirmed. (It was revealed in All
            Hail King Julien that he is at least more than 50 years old. He is old enough to be in history books of
            Madagascar and the lemur kingdom.) He is a side character in Madagascar, Madagascar Escape 2 Africa, and
            Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted as both the adam and the eve of his species, a side character in Penguins
            of Madagascar (film), a major character in The Penguins of Madagascar (series), and the tritagonist of All
            Hail King Julien. He loves King Julien's feet, an obsession which started when he saw King Julien using them
            to kick some foosas in the first episode of All Hail King Julien. In The Penguins of Madagascar, he is
            somewhat cute toward the other zoo animals.

        <p class="mp">
            Mort meets King Julien and Maurice for the first time when he falls out of a tree in “King Me”. Mort is
            depicted as an important character in All Hail King Julien, and is one of the four members of King Julien's
            royal circle, along with Maurice and Clover. It is in All Hail King Julien that his love towards King
            Julien's feet began. Mort is somewhat creepy at times, but also humorous. He claims to live in his own
            world, and can turn into many versions of himself inside his mind. However, in All Hail King Julien: Exiled,
            he becomes one of the significant characters who assist King Julien, by getting information and spying on
            the enemy, Koto, while he acted as his jester. Mort was able to plot plans to assassinate Koto, but was
            unable to be successful due to his bad luck. He kept on getting hurt himself when he tried to hurt Koto.
            Mort was clever enough to generate tactful plans in trying to free the prisoners in various ways. He played
            a crucial role in collecting an army (the Mort Horde) for the war against Koto. His actions helped King
            Julien, leading to his victory. It is indicated in Revenge of the Prom that Mort was abused by Grammy Mort,
            leading to her consumption. He creates a romantic relationship with Zora in the All Hail King Julien: Exiled
            and marries her in The Day Before Tomorrow. However, in King Julien is Watching You, Zora leaves Mort and
            decides to live with Uncle King Julien. But Mort doesn't really seem to mind that. ( Probably because Zora
            annoyed Mort by mentioning 'family' and flattering him.)
